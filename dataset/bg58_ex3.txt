[CODE]  
public class Bg583 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
         
       /* Outer comment start
           /* Attempting a nested comment */
        System.out.println("This won't print");
        */
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Java does not support nested multi-line comments. The first `*/` inside the outer comment prematurely closes it, causing syntax errors in the remaining code
KH: Avoid nesting `/* ... */` comments. Use single-line comments (`//`) inside multi-line comments if needed.
