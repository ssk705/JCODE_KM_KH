[CODE]  
public class DecrementLogic {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 3;
        if (a-- == 2) {
            System.out.println("Condition met");
        }
    }
}
[OUTPUT]  
KM:Post-decrement (`a--`) compares the original value (3) with 2, so the condition fails. The decrement happens after the comparison, but the condition is never true.  
KH:If you meant to decrement first and then compare, use pre-decrement (`--a`). Alternatively, move the decrement outside the condition for clarity.
