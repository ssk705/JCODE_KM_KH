[CODE]
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    
    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public static void resetCounter() {
        increment();  
        count = 0;  
    }
}
[OUTPUT]  
KM:`increment()` is non-static and cannot be called from static `resetCounter()` without an instance.  
KH: Create a `Counter` object in `resetCounter()` and use its methods/fields, or  Declare `count` and `increment()` as `static` if shared across all instances.
