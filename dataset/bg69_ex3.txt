[CODE]
public class DoublyLinkedList {
    class Node {
        int data;
        Node next;
        Node prev;
    }

    public void deleteHead() {
        if (head == null) return;
        if (head == tail) {
            head = tail = null;
        } else {
            head = head.next;  
        }
    }
}

[OUTPUT]
KM:Deleting the head in a multi-node list fails to set the new head's `prev` to `null`, leaving a dangling reference to the old head. 
KH:After `head = head.next`, add `head.prev = null` to break the link to the old head. Also, handle the case where the list becomes empty.
