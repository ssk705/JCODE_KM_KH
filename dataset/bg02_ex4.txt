[CODE]
public class Bg24 {
    public static boolean isZero(int num) {
        return num = 0;
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: Using '=' instead of '==' in the return statement attempts to assign 0 to num, which is invalid in a boolean context and causes a compilation error.
KH: Use '==' to compare num with 0. The method should return the result of the equality check.
