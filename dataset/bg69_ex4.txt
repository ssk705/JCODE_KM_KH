[CODE]
 public class DoublyLinkedList {
     class Node {
        int data;
        Node next;
        Node prev;
    }
    public void removeTail() {
    if (tail == null) return;
    if (head == tail) {
        head = tail = null;
    } else {
        tail = tail.prev;  
    }
}
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: After moving `tail` backwards, the new tail's `next` pointer still references the removed node, causing a dangling forward link.  
KH: After `tail = tail.prev`, set `tail.next = null` to break the forward link from the new tail to the old removed node.
