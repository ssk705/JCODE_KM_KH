[CODE]
public class Greeting {
 
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
      
}
[OUTPUT]
KM:The class `Greeting ` is missing a closing curly brace at the end. The last curly brace closes the `main` method, but the class body remains unclosed.  
KH:Add a closing curly brace `}` at the very end of the file after the `main` method to terminate the class definition.
