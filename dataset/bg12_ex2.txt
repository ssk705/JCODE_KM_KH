[CODE]  
public class Bg122 {  
    public static String getSchoolName() {  
        return "ABC University";  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Student student = new Student();  
        System.out.println(student.getSchoolName());  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The static method `getSchoolName` belongs to the class `Student`, not to its instances. Using `student.getSchoolName()` incorrectly treats it as an instance method.  
KH: Call the method directly via the class name: `Student.getSchoolName()`.
