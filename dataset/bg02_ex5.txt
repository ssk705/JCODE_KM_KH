[CODE]
public class Bg25 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 3, b = 5;
        String result = (a = b) ? "Equal" : "Not equal";
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The assignment 'a = b' in the ternary condition modifies the value of a and evaluates to an int, which is not a boolean, causing a compilation error.
KH: Replace '=' with '==' to compare a and b without modifying their values.
