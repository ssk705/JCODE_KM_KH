[CODE]
public class Queue {
    private Node head, tail;
    private class Node {
        int data;
        Node next;
    }
    public int dequeue() {
        if (head == null) throw new RuntimeException("Empty!");
        Node temp = head;
        head = head.next;
        return temp.data;
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The dequeued node (`temp`) isn't dereferenced, causing a memory leak as the node remains linked to the queue internally.  
KH: Set `temp.next = null` before returning to allow garbage collection of the removed node.
