[CODE]  
public class Bg165 {  
    public static int divide(int a, int b) {  
        try {  
            return a / b;  
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {  
            System.out.println("Division by zero!");  
        }  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: If an ArithmeticException is caught (e.g., division by zero), the catch block does not return a value, causing the method to exit without returning an int.  
KH: Add a return statement in the catch block (e.g., return 0;) or after the try-catch block to handle the error case.
