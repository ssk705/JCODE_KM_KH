[CODE]  
public class Bg582 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* This is a comment about the calculation
        int a = 5 + 3;
        System.out.println("Result: " + a);
    }
} 
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The multi-line comment lacks a closing `*/`, causing all subsequent code to be treated as part of the comment. This results in unreachable code errors.  
KH: Always ensure every `/*` has a matching `*/` at the end of the comment section.
