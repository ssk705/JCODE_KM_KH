[CODE]
public class Student {
    private int id;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();
        System.out.println(s.id);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM:id` is declared `private` in `Student`, so it's inaccessible outside the `Student` class. Direct access in `Main` causes a compilation error.  
KH:Declare a public getter method (e.g., `public int getId()`) in `Student` to access `id` from other classes.
