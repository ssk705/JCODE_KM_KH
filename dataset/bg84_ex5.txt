[CODE]
public class ArrayStack {
    private int[] stack;
    private int top;
    
    public ArrayStack(int capacity) {
        stack = new int[capacity];
        top = -1;
    }
    
    public boolean isFull() {
        return top == stack.length;  
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: `isFull()` checks if `top == stack.length`, but the valid top index is `stack.length - 1`. This misses overflow when `top == stack.length - 1`, allowing out-of-bounds pushes.
KH: Fix the condition to `return top == stack.length - 1` to accurately detect a full stack.
