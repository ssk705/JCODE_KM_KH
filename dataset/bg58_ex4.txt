[CODE]  
public class Message {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Hello /* This is not a comment */ World";
        System.out.println(text);
    }
} 
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Text inside a string literal (`"..."`) is not treated as code. Here, `/* ... */` is part of the string, not a comment, leading to unexpected output.   
KH: Ensure comments are only placed outside strings. To add documentation, place comments before/after the string declaration.
