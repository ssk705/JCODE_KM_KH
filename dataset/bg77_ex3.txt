[CODE]  
public class TemperatureCheck {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int temp1 = 30;  
        int temp2 = 40;  
        double midpoint = (temp1 + temp2) / 2;  
        System.out.println(midpoint);   
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The sum of temp1 and temp2 (70) is divided by 2 using integer division, resulting in 35, which is then stored as 35.0 in midpoint.  
KH: Use a double literal for the divisor (e.g., 2.0) to force floating-point division.
