[CODE]
class LinkedList {
    Node head;
    void printList() {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.println(current.data);
            current.next = current; 
        }
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: `current.next = current` creates an infinite loop by pointing each node to itself.  
KH: Traverse correctly by updating `current` to `current.next` (e.g., `current = current.next`).
