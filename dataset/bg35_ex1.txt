[CODE]
class Vehicle {
    private String type;
    public Vehicle(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car() {
        System.out.println("Car created");
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM:When a superclass lacks a default constructor, subclasses must explicitly call an existing superclass constructor using `super(...)` as the first line in their own constructor 
KH:Ensure the subclass constructor explicitly invokes one of the superclass’s declared constructors using `super(arguments)`. This call must be the first statement in the subclass constructor.
