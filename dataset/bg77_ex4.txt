[CODE]  
public class Recipe {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int flour = 500;  
        int portions = 3;  
        double flourPerPortion = flour / portions;  
        System.out.println(flourPerPortion);  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: Dividing two integers (500/3) results in 166 due to integer division, which is then cast to 166.0.  
KH: Cast one variable to double (e.g., (double)flour / portions) to retain decimal precision.
