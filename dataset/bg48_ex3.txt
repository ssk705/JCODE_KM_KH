[CODE]
class Fruit {}
class Apple extends Fruit {
    void peel() { System.out.println("Peeling..."); }
}
class Banana extends Fruit {}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Fruit fruit = new Banana();
        Apple apple = (Apple) fruit;  
        apple.peel();
    }
} 
[OUTPUT]
KM:`fruit` is a `Banana`, not an `Apple`. Casting to `Apple` is invalid.  The inheritance hierarchy (`Banana` and `Apple` are siblings) makes them incompatible for direct casting.  
KH: Check the object's actual type with `instanceof` before casting.Ensure the reference points to an `Apple` object if you need `Apple`-specific methods.
