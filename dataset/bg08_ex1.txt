[OUTPUT]  
KM: The `swap` method is called with arguments in the wrong order (`y, x` instead of `x, y`), but in Java, primitive parameters are passed by value, so swapping them inside the method has no effect on the original variables.  
KH: Understand that swapping primitives requires returning values or using a different approach. To fix the argument order mistake, ensure the method is called with `x, y`, but note that this still won’t swap the original variables due to immutability of primitives.
