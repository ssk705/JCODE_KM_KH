public class Temperature {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double celsius = 25.0;
        {
            double fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32;
            System.out.println(fahrenheit);
        }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM:The inner block for temperature conversion is closed, but the `Temperature` class itself is missing its closing curly brace.  
KH:Insert a closing curly brace `}` at the end of the file to terminate the `Temperature` class body.
