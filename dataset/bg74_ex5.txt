[OUTPUT]  
KM: A do-while loop risks an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the element is not in the array, as it continues iterating beyond the array’s length.  
KH: Use a while or for loop with a condition to stop when `i` exceeds the array length, ensuring safe iteration or add (i < numbers.length) as a condition
