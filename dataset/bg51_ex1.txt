[CODE]
 public class Queue {
    private Node head, tail;
    private class Node {
        int data;
        Node next;
    }

    public int dequeue() {
        if (head == null) throw new RuntimeException("Empty!");
        int data = head.data;
        head = head.next;
        return data;
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM:The `tail` pointer isn't updated when the last item is dequeued, leaving `tail` pointing to a removed node.  
KH:After updating `head`, add a check `if (head == null) tail = null;` to reset `tail` when the queue becomes empty.
