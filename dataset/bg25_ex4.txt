[CODE]
public class Bg254 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 20;
        boolean isStudent = true;
        if (age < 25 isStudent) {  
            System.out.println("You get a discount!");
        }
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM:The condition `age < 25 isStudent` lacks the logical AND operator (`&&`) to combine both expressions.  
KH:Add the `&&` operator between `age < 25` and `isStudent` to properly link the conditions.
