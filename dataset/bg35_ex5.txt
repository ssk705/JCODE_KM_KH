        System.out.println(x);  
        System.out.println(super.x);  
    }

[OUTPUT]
KM:Declaring a field `x` in both superclass and subclass creates two separate fields. This is called *field hiding*, not overriding. The `obj.x` in `main` prints `10` because field access is determined by the *reference type* (`A`), not the object type (`B`).  
KH: Avoid reusing field names in subclasses. If needed, access the superclass field explicitly via `super.x` in the subclass. For polymorphism, use methods (not fields) to access state.
