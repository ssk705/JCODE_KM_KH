[CODE]
public class Bg54 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int count = 10, count > 0, count--) {
            System.out.println("Countdown: " + count);
        }
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The for loop uses commas instead of semicolons between its components, causing incorrect loop structure and likely unintended behavior.
KH: Insert semicolons after the initialization (`count = 10`) and condition (`count > 0`) to define the loop structure properly.
