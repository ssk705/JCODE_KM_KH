public class Bg52 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int x = 0, x < 3, x++) {
            for(int y = 0, y < 2, y++) {
                System.out.println(x + "," + y);
            }
        }
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: Both outer and inner for loops incorrectly use commas to separate their components instead of semicolons.
KH: Use semicolons after the initialization and condition in both loops while keeping commas only for multiple variables in the same section (if applicable).
