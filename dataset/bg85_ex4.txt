[CODE]
public class LinkedList {
    Node head;
    class Node {
        int data;
        Node next;
        Node(int d) { data = d; }
    }

    void printList() {
        Node current = head;
        while (current.next != null) {
            System.out.println(current.data);
            current = current.next;
        }
    }
    
}
[OUTPUT]
KM:The loop condition `current.next != null` skips the last node. When `current` is the tail node, its `next` is `null`, so the loop exits without printing the tail's data
KH:Change the loop condition to `current != null` to include all nodes. Move the print statement inside the loop to avoid skipping the tail.
