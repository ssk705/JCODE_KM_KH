[CODE]
public class Bg245 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x;
        boolean condition = false;
        if (condition) {
            x = 10;
        }
        System.out.println("x is " + x);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM: The variable 'x' might not be initialized if the 'if' condition is false, leading to a compilation error. Java requires variables to be definitely assigned before use.
KH: Initialize 'x' when declaring it or provide an else block that assigns a value to 'x' to cover all possible paths.
