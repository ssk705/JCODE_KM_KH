[CODE]
public class Bg255 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int sum = a b;  
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM:The line `int sum = a b;` is missing an operator (`+`) between `a` and `b`. Java interprets `a b` as invalid syntax.  
KH:Insert the addition operator (`+`) between `a` and `b` to calculate the sum.
