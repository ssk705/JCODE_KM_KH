[CODE]
public class Book {
    String title;
    public Book(String t) { title = t; }

    void duplicateBook(Book original) {
        Book copy = new Book(original);
    }
}
[OUTPUT]
KM:Using `new Book(original)` assumes a copy constructor exists, but none is defined.  
KH:Create a copy constructor in `Book` that takes a `Book` object as an argument to initialize the new instance.
