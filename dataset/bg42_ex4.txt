[CODE]
public class Counter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
[OUTPUT]
KM:The `Counter` class definition is incomplete because there is no closing brace after the `for` loop and `main` method
KH:Add a final closing curly brace `}` at the end of the file to signify the end of the `Counter` class.
