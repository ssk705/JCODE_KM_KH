[CODE]  
public class Bg102 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        String str = "test";  
        int len = str. length();  
        System.out.println(len);  
    }  
    
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: A space after the period in "str. length()" breaks the method call syntax. the space after the period is considered bad style. 
KH: Ensure there is no space between the object reference and the method name, e.g., "str.length()".
