[CODE]  
public class Bg275 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int price = 20;  
        total = price * 1.08;  
        System.out.println(total);  
    }  
}  
[OUTPUT]  
KM: The variable 'total' is not declared before assignment, and its data type is inconsistent (possible double).  
KH: Declare 'total' with the correct data type (e.g., double) before assigning the calculated value to it.
